    <h1>Education</h1>
    <h2>High School</h2>
    <p>At high school I have elected to take a wide variety of AP classes and create a rigorous and academic schedule.
        Additionally, I've taken IT and digital technologies classes internationally. In 2022, I competed in a
        state-wide mobile development competition called Just Start It! in Western Australia (WA) with a team. We were
        in the top 10 teams and got to present at finals. Lastly, I've taken Computer Science Principles and got
        certified in the subject for the state of Utah.</p>
    <h2>Technical College</h2>
    <p>The local technical college offers IT, Cybersecurity, Data Analytics, and Web &amp; Mobile Development classes.
        I've taken many of them and am working towards a certificate.</p>
